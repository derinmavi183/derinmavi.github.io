Talk is a powerplay. A simulation. And self observing thing is which is very interesting because if your world choise says your internal state.

Acu bir gerçek olarak konuşmanın güzelliği içeriği kadar önem taşır. Yazmak bu anlamda bir hiledir çünkü sizi sizden soyutlar.

Sadly there is no way outside a powerplay. But being aware and letting aware. You kind you beautiful well spoken well read so any chanse people tahammül etsin your  powerplay. If they ok with that you can go on. They are letting you in. I always afraid to that. Ok powerplay is a cringe sometimes but if you do it well than its not a cringe and you can actually save people. And very well know objective truth is different from our internal truth so dont be so sure. But its a catastrophic thing because what you know. But let me save you what they know really.

What value you can add? Educate People. Entertain People. Mntain People. I always see them as a think to maintain. And it is the right way. And of course you can fuck them to.
