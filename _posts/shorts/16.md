There is a very common psychological problem for men of this age.
This is the problem of not being adult. The problem of approaching life's events in a childish way.
We know how hard life was in the 1800s and early 1900s. We do not know about previous difficulties, perhaps because the record was not kept so well.
But life was harsh back than. Especially very difficult for a young man. You can see this in the 2019 Oscar-nominated movie Lighthouse.
In this movie, the character Thomas Howard, played by Robbert Pattinson, gets a job as a lighthouse keeper on an island near New England in the 1890s.
But working at the lighthouse is so difficult that it makes those working there lose their minds. I think this constitutes the reality of those years.
