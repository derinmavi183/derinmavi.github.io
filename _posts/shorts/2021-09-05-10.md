I think there are some tricks for mating of course why not. And it is not bad or immoral at all.

For the person who does it is like an harvest. Men generally try to be better try nicely blow up.
If you are really better than them you have access to it. You little by little prove you are more thoughtful. More energetic clever etc.
But you have to be very sneaky. You dont want to look like a douchebag. Process itself has its exciting and fun too. Maybe even cutting here is sometimes even better.
